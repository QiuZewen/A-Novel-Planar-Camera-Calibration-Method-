# A-Novel-Planar-Camera-Calibration-Method-
we propose a novel planar camera calibration method based on pixel equivalent function，Experiments conducted on checkerboard and standard block demonstrate that the proposed method has higher accuracy and stability compared to the MATLAB Calibrator and the OpenCV library, which represent Zhang’s calibration method and its variants.
